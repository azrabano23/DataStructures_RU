## üß† Project Highlights

### 1. üî° Braille Translator (Binary Search Tree)

**What It Does**:  
Implements a translator between Braille and English using a custom-built Binary Search Tree. It supports:
- Symbol tree construction from encoding files
- Braille-to-English translation via recursive traversal
- English-to-Braille encoding lookup
- Efficient prefix search (autocomplete)
- Intelligent deletion and cleanup of orphaned branches

**DSA Concepts Used**:  
- Custom BST
- Tree traversal (preorder, DFS)
- Prefix-based search
- Symbol abstraction and node encapsulation

**Why It Matters**:  
Demonstrates real-world application of trees in accessibility tools.

### 2. üïµÔ∏è Cyber Crime Investigation (Hash Table & Priority Queue)

**What It Does**:  
Simulates a law enforcement-grade cyber crime system that:
- Stores and manages hacker profiles using a dynamically resizing hash table
- Supports insertion, lookup, removal, and merging of hacker data
- Identifies the most dangerous hackers using a max-priority queue
- Filters hacker data by geographic incident locations

**DSA Concepts Used**:  
- Custom Hash Table (with linked list chaining)
- Hash code normalization
- Dynamic resizing
- Max-Priority Queue
- Incident-linked Hacker objects

**Why It Matters**:  
Models real-world threat intelligence systems and demonstrates scalable hash-based directory management.

### 3. üé∂ Kindergarten Simulator (Linked Lists & Circular Structures)

**What It Does**:  
Simulates a classroom management system where:
- Students queue, are seated, and play musical chairs
- Eliminated players re-enter a sorted queue by name
- The winner is seated separately

**DSA Concepts Used**:  
- Singly Linked Lists
- Circular Linked Lists (CLL)
- Sorted insertion
- Queue processing
- In-place node manipulation

**Why It Matters**:  
Demonstrates understanding of low-level list operations and memory-linked node behavior in an interactive simulation.

### 4. üó∫Ô∏è RUMaps ‚Äì Rutgers Traffic and Navigation System (Graph Algorithms)

**What It Does**:  
Creates a fully navigable map system using graph traversal, optimized routing, and live traffic modeling:
- Intersections and roads modeled as nodes and weighted edges
- DFS for reachability
- BFS for minimal-intersection routing
- Dijkstra‚Äôs algorithm (custom variant) for fastest path based on traffic
- Road geometry parsed from coordinate files and distance calculated via Euclidean metric

**DSA Concepts Used**:  
- Adjacency list graph
- DFS, BFS
- Custom Dijkstra‚Äôs pathfinding with traffic weights
- Coordinate geometry
- Hash maps and priority queues

**Why It Matters**:  
Models real-world GPS and routing systems with dynamic traffic analysis, mimicking tools like Google Maps or Waze.

## üíº Java Skills

These projects showcase my ability to:
- Build from scratch (no use of built-in Java `Map` or `TreeMap`)
- Write efficient, scalable algorithms that reflect real-world logic
- Think critically about system states, edge cases, and performance
- Work independently and debug deeply nested logic
- Apply academic CS rigor to practical problem-solving

If you're seeking a candidate who understands the "why" behind every data structure, can implement them efficiently, and applies them to meaningful simulations and systems‚Äîlet‚Äôs talk.
